    title: "Overcoming Anxiety - Bhagavad Gita",
    description:
      "In Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna teaches that anxiety arises from attachment to the results of actions. By practicing detachment and surrendering to the divine, one can overcome anxiety. 'Do your duty, but do not worry about the outcome.' Anxiety is the product of focusing too much on future uncertainties. Learning to live in the present moment helps to dissolve anxiety. Krishna also says, 'The one who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires—that person has peace, who is free from all anxieties and attachments.' Anxiety often comes from the fear of the unknown and the overthinking of consequences. By practicing mindfulness and meditation, one can transcend such mental disturbances.",
    solution:
      "To overcome anxiety, focus on your present actions without attachment to outcomes. Practice mindfulness and meditation to calm your mind, and remember that peace comes from within. Detach from the constant flow of desires and surrender to the divine, trusting that everything will unfold as it should."
